# MyApps
These are some of small tools I have made over the years. (some need JDK 9.0.4)

In alfabetic order those are:
-BulkRename -> old code; for renaming a lot of files.
-cloneFinder -> old code; for fiding duplicate files
-Dedup -> more modern approch to deduplicating files with use of cahe to reduce load on drive and network
-IntegrityCHK -> old code; checks if two location costain the same files - (there was a bit of mess with tepmporary files)
=PhysicsEx -> new code; experiments with 2d and 3d physics engine -> render in JavaFx
-Python -> tools i made for working with Python ML
--GenerateLabels -> gathers all unique lables from files createed by labelImg
-Sample -> abandoned project
-StoryLayoutApp -> abandoned project; was intended as aplication for creating interactive novel stories / games.
